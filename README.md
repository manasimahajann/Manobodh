Manache Shlokh app with translation


There are 2 floating buttons on the app "Play" and "Pause"

List view will play the verses as and when you click on any verse from the list.

Play is a button to start playing from user's input till the end of the list.
Issue here is if user goes ahead and puts in a new number again, after some time 2 verses start to play simultaneously.

Pause button will pause the current verse.
